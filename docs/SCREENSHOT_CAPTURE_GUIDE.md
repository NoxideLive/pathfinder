# Screenshot Capture Guide for EOL 1h Status Feature

## Purpose
This guide provides step-by-step instructions for capturing screenshots of the new EOL 1h (critical) status feature for documentation purposes.

## Prerequisites
- Running instance of Pathfinder application
- Access to a map with wormhole connections
- Screen capture tool (built-in OS tool or dedicated application)
- Image editor (optional, for annotations)

## Screenshot Locations
All screenshots should be saved in: `/img/gallery/`

Use the following naming convention:
- `connection_eol_menu.jpg` - Context menu showing EOL options
- `connection_eol_1h_active.jpg` - Connection with 1h EOL status active
- `connection_eol_comparison.jpg` - Multiple connections with different statuses

## Screenshot 1: Context Menu

**Filename:** `connection_eol_menu.jpg`

**Steps to Capture:**
1. Open Pathfinder and navigate to a map with wormhole connections
2. Right-click on any wormhole connection to open the context menu
3. Ensure the menu displays both EOL options:
   - "toggle EOL (4h)"
   - "toggle EOL (1h)" (the new feature)
4. Position your screen capture to include:
   - The full context menu
   - Part of the connection being modified
   - Enough surrounding map context for clarity
5. Capture the screenshot
6. Verify the image is clear and readable

**Image Specifications:**
- Format: JPG
- Resolution: High quality (at least 1920x1080 or higher)
- Size: Compress to ~100-200KB for web use
- Ensure menu text is sharp and legible

## Screenshot 2: EOL 1h Status Active

**Filename:** `connection_eol_1h_active.jpg`

**Steps to Capture:**
1. Right-click on a wormhole connection
2. Select "toggle EOL (1h)" from the context menu
3. Click away to close the menu
4. The connection should now display the EOL 1h status indicator
5. Position your view to show:
   - The connection with EOL 1h status clearly visible
   - Connected systems on both ends
   - Any visual indicators specific to the 1h status
6. Capture the screenshot
7. Verify the status indicator is clearly visible

**Image Specifications:**
- Format: JPG
- Resolution: High quality
- Size: Compress to ~100-200KB
- Focus on the connection and immediate surroundings

## Screenshot 3: Status Comparison

**Filename:** `connection_eol_comparison.jpg`

**Steps to Capture:**
1. Create or find a map view with multiple wormhole connections
2. Ensure you have at least three connections visible:
   - One normal connection (no EOL status)
   - One with EOL (4h) status applied
   - One with EOL (1h) status applied
3. Arrange your view so all three are visible in one screenshot
4. Label or annotate (if possible) to show:
   - "Normal"
   - "EOL 4h"
   - "EOL 1h"
5. Capture the screenshot
6. Consider adding arrows or labels in post-processing to make it educational

**Image Specifications:**
- Format: JPG
- Resolution: High quality
- Size: Compress to ~100-200KB
- Should clearly show visual differences between states

## Post-Processing Guidelines

For all screenshots:
1. **Crop**: Remove any unnecessary UI elements or personal information
2. **Resize**: Ensure consistent dimensions across all screenshots
3. **Compress**: Optimize file size without losing clarity
4. **Annotate** (optional): Add arrows, circles, or labels to highlight key features
5. **Privacy**: Remove any sensitive character names, corporation names, or locations if needed

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing screenshots, verify:
- [ ] Images are in JPG format
- [ ] File sizes are reasonable (100-200KB each)
- [ ] Text and icons are clear and readable
- [ ] Context menu items are fully visible
- [ ] Connection status indicators are obvious
- [ ] No sensitive personal information is visible
- [ ] Filenames follow the naming convention
- [ ] Images are saved in `/img/gallery/` directory

## Alternative: Screen Recording

If static screenshots are insufficient, consider:
1. Recording a short video demonstration
2. Showing the process of:
   - Opening the context menu
   - Selecting the EOL 1h option
   - The visual change on the connection
3. Export key frames as screenshots
4. Or provide the video as supplementary documentation

## Notes

- Take screenshots at standard resolution (1920x1080) for consistency
- Avoid HDR or unusual color profiles
- Use the default Pathfinder theme/colors for consistency
- Multiple takes may be needed to get the perfect shot
- Consider the audience - make it clear even for new users
